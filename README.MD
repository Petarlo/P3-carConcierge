  ## Description
  The aim of this project was to use build a single page MERN application to solve a real world problem. 
  I chose to build a car research tool to help people who are not interested in cars and want to avoid the hard sell.
  In addition to the car search engine, I also incorporated a blog page that will be managed by admin to provide bias free car news. There is also comment functionality for logged in users.
  I also want to add a garage feature for the User to save favourite cars, blogs as well as their own vehicle information for quick reference.
